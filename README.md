## Dues

Each year, a fee is due **two weeks before the draft**. This is used entirely to cover [awards](#awards).

The fee is currently **$100**. A vote will be held yearly to determine the fee for the year; unanimous consent is required to alter the fee. If the fee is altered, a subsequent vote will be held to determine awards.

## Awards

Awards are paid out on the **Tuesday immediately following Week 16**.

| | Amount |
| --- | --- |
| First place | $720 |
| Second place | $240 |
| Third place | $120 |
| Most points in regular season | $120 |

## Draft Order

The first six draft picks are awarded to the teams ranked 6-12 at the end of the year. This is to incentivize active participation in the consolation bracket.

## Keepers

Each team is permitted to retain **two** players from the previous season to play in the upcoming season. All players are eligible to be kept, except:

- Players drafted in the first round

If a team choose to keep a player, the team forfeits a draft pick.

- If the player kept was drafted in the previous season, the team forfeits its pick from the same round the player was drafted in. If the player kept was undrafted, the team forfeits its pick in the 15th round.
- If a team chooses to keep two players drafted in the same round, or two undrafted players, the team forfeits its pick from one round earlier or the 14th round, respectively.
- In each following year, the team forfeits a pick worth double the value of the pick forfeited in the year prior.
- A player can no longer be kept if his value is greater than a first-round pick.
