### Keepers

Each team is permitted to retain *two* players from the previous season to play in the upcoming season. All players are eligible to be kept, except:

- Players drafted in the first round

If a team choose to keep a player, the team forfeits a draft pick.

- If the player kept was drafted in the previous season, the team forfeits its pick from the same round the player was drafted in. If the player kept was undrafted, the team forfeits its pick in the 15th round.
- In each following year, the team forfeits a pick worth double the value of the pick forfeited in the year prior.
- A player can no longer be kept if his value is greater than a first-round pick.
