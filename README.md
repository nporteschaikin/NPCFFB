## Draft

The draft is held on **any date after August 15 of each year**; unanimous participation is required.

### Order

The first six draft picks are awarded to the teams ranked 6-12 at the end of the year. This is to incentivize active participation in the consolation bracket.

| Rank in previous season | Draft pick |
| --- | --- |
| 1st | 12th |
| 2nd | 11th |
| 3rd | 10th |
| 4th | 9th |

| 8th | 2nd |
| 9th | 3rd |
| 10th | 4th |
| 11th | 5th |
| 12th | 6th |

<sub id="draft-order-1"><sup>1</sup> Prior to 2018 draft, the fifth place team received the eighth pick and the sixth place team received the seventh pick.</sub>

## Waivers

Waiver priority is determined by **free-agent acquisition budget (FAAB)** bidding.<sup>[1](#waivers-1)</sup>

- Each team is allocated a **$200** FAAB every year to bid on unclaimed players that are in waivers.
- Each week, a player's waiver period **begins at his game's start time and ends on Tuesday night**. In that time, teams can blindly bid to claim the player off waivers. $0 dollar bids are permitted.
- The team with the highest bid at the end of the waiver period wins the player,<sup>[2](#waivers-2)</sup> and the winning team's bid price is deducted from their remaning FAAB for the year. Losing bids are not deducted from the team's FAAB.
- Between each waiver period, unclaimed players are available on a first-come, first-serve basis at no cost to the acquiring team's FAAB.

<sub id="waivers-1"><sup>1</sup> Before 2019, a continual rolling list was used to determine waiver priority.</sub><br />
<sub id="waivers-2"><sup>2</sup> If two teams bid the same price for a player, claims are processed in reverse order of standings and each successful claim moves a team to the end of the waiver priority list.</sub>

## Keepers

Each team is permitted to retain **two** players from the previous season to play in the upcoming season. All players are eligible to be kept, except:

- Players drafted in the first round.

If a team choose to keep a player, the team forfeits a draft pick.

- If the player kept was drafted in the previous season, the team forfeits its pick from the same round the player was drafted in. If the player kept was undrafted, the team forfeits its pick in the 15th round.
- If a team chooses to keep two players drafted in the same round, or two undrafted players, the team forfeits its pick from one round earlier or the 14th round, respectively.
- In each following year, the team forfeits a pick worth double the value of the pick forfeited in the year prior.<sup>[1](#keepers-1)</sup>
- A player can no longer be kept if his value is a first-round pick.

Keeper selections are subject to approval by the commissioner and are **due no later than a week prior to the draft**.

<sub id="keepers-1"><sup>1</sup> If the pick forfeited for a player is an odd round number, the pick forefeited in the following draft should be rounded down in value; i.e. the fifth pick is forfeited for a player whose value was a ninth-round pick in the previous draft.</sub>
